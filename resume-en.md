> I’m a Web Designer for over 10 years creating Layouts with Photoshop, Illustrator, HTML5/CSS3, Javascript (jQuery) and Bootstrap. For projects of Institutional Websites, Online Catalogs, and Small Virtual Stores, I use WordPress with creation of simple themes and implementation of layout in ready themes.

> In order to become a Fullstack Javascript Developer, I have been updating on the new features of ECMASCRIPT to deepen my knowledge and make me, master in technologies like: Javascript (Vanilla), Node (Express), Vue, React and React Native form mobile apps. In addition learn all ecosystems that involve these technologies, such as MongoDB, Jenkins, Docker, Webpack, etc.
